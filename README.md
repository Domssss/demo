Inventory used for the assessment:
CICD Pipeline: Azure DevOps
Language: Python
IaaC: Terraform
Cloud: Azure
Deployments: kubectl
Database: Azure Redis
Infra: kubernetes minikube in VM

Bonus Question:
The infra is already set for deploying a working web application. In order for it to support high demand needed by the customer, all I need to configure is the size of the VM where the application is hosted as well as the number of replicas of the deployments application with HPA setup so it can scale easily in high traffic.
